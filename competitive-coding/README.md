# Competative Coding
This segment of this repo is dedicated for Coding, Data structure and Algorithm
These are the below questions which you have to answer
1. Array
  - You are given with an array and an integer "sum". You have to find subarray with sum value as "sum"?
  - You are given an array of DISTINCT elements, rearrange the elements of array as given condition in O(n) time. The converted array should be in form a[0] < a[1] > a[2] < a[3] > a[4] < a[5] and so on... ?
  - You are given with an array of size n and each value at index position i describe the hieght of the bar at that position. Calculate the total unit of water you can trap in between these bars?(assume unit of hieght of bar=1unit of water)
  - You are given an array of positive and negative numbers. Find the subarray with maximum product value?(expected time complexity: O(n) & expected extra space: O(1))
  - You are given an array of 0's,1's and 2's. We have to sort the array? (expected time complexity: O(n) & expected extra space: O(1))
 2. String
  - You are given with String and you have to return all permutation of that string?
  - You are given a string (For eg: Input str = "1??0?101"). You have to return all strings by replacing '?' as '1' or '0'(hint: use queue)
  - You are given with a String of 1's and 0's(It is the binary representation an integer). You have to find next decimal greater number with same number of 1's and 0's (in it's binary form) as input string? 
  ( 
    Input : 1001
    Output : 1010
    Here n = (9)10 = (1001)2
    next greater = (10)10 = (1010)2
  )
  - You are given a string and find the longest palindromic substring?
  - You are given a string and you have to return the number of pairs of substrings which are "anagram" to each other?
 3. Matrix
  - You are given a matrix of size nXn. You have to rotate it 90 degree anti-clockwise?
  - You are given a matrix of size nXn which is row-wise and column-wise sorted. You have to find a number from the matrix with time complexity of O(n)?
  - You given with a matrix of 1's and 0's. You have to find bigest square matrix with in it, which contain 1's only?
 4. Linkedlist
  - Create a linkedlist and reverse it with changing the pointers?
  - Find loop present in a linkedlist or not? If loop is present then remove it?
  - You are given with two sorted linkedlist. Merge them into one sorted linkedlist?
  - You are given two numbers as linkedlist. Find thier sum as linkedlist?
     (input: a= 1->2->3->4
             b= 6->6
      output: 1->3->0->0)
  - Sort a linkedlist of 0's, 1's, 2's?
